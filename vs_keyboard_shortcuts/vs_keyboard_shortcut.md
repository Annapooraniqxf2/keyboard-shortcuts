Here we are going to use a lot of Visual Studio Code, Bash and Qxf2 framework. Add the folder for example where you have stored all your Github repository as your workspace(if not done). We will work on our Qxf2 Page Object Model framework(https://github.com/qxf2/qxf2-page-object-model) and keyboard shortcuts repository(https://github.com/Annapooraniqxf2/keyboard-shortcuts). So make sure you have cloned those two repositories and it's in your workspace.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. In this keyboard shortcuts repository we have a file called 'file1.py'. Now can you open the file without using the mouse in the Visual Studio Code and write the Python program (Fizz buzz) using methods. After completing the program, run it in the Visual Studio Code and Git bash

2. Open a file 'fizzbuzz_gotoline.py' in Visual Studio Code, Goto the end of the file and check any extra space is there. If Yes delete the extra lines and save the program. Run the 'fizzbuzz_gotoline.py' program in the bash and see the error. Come to visual studio code and search the line number and fix the error. Go to git bash and run the program. To alternate between Visual Studio Code and Git bash use the keyboard.

3. Open the 'find_and_replace.py' file and search the word called 'app' and replace all with 'apps'.

4. After some time you are going to work with a repository which contains lots of directories and files. Each files will be having a lot of methods and classes. Now imagine that you are working on writing Selenium test using our Qxf2 framework. Now you have to search the method named switch_page occurs in which file. Can you try to use the keyboard and commands to search the method?

5. Now, as part of the exercises you might have opened lots of tabs. Can you try to move between the tabs and check what are all the files opened and close the files if you are not going to work on it.

6.Create a new file called 'fizzbuzz_funtion.py' and open one more file which is already existing in the 'fizzbuzz_gotoline.py'. Copy the lines and paste it in the 'fizzbuzz_funtion.py'. Now modify the file by using only functions not with OOPS concepts. Now open one more bash don't close the already existing opened bash and run the program.
