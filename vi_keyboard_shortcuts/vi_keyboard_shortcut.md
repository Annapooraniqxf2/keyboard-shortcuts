Here we are going to use lot of vi editor. If you are having windows machine either you can create a virtual os and install ubuntu on it. If you have an aws account create an instance and ssh into it.

1. Create a directory called keyboard_operations. Go to the directory and create a new file called fizzbuzz.py. Now open the created file in the vi/vim editor. Now write a simple fizzbuzz program without using methods and classess. Save the program and come out of it

2. Open the same file one more time and try to refactor the program. For example use the functions to write the same program. Since you have changed the program go to the starting of the file and change the docstring which is starting of the program.

3. Open the file and go to the last line of the program and check is there any syntax error, Extra spaces added. Go to the starting of the program delete the docstrings which you have added early and add new lines.If you couldnt frame the docstring with proper format so better to go with the previous one. So undo the delete

4. Open the file called file_vi_keyboard_shortcuts. I know this file won't be in your machine. SO try to copy the file from your native machine to the ubuntu. Open the file and go the end of the file. Now go to line number 7 and go the strating of the line. Now change the string to 'you can delete this line from the file'
