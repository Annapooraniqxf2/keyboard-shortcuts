"""
Here we give a set of exercises to practice. All these exercises to be performed by using keyboard. To perform all these exercises we are going to use our Qxf2 Page Object Model reposiotory. So makesure you have already cloned the reposiotory in your local machine.
"""

1. search through a directory for a file
    I hope you have already gone through our Page Object Model. So You have to find in which file we have kept all the common selenium methods. If you still didnt get it I can say that it's Base_Page.py. Can you please search the file location without exploring into windows, without using mouse?

2. create a new file without leaving the current directory
    If I ask you to create a file inside a particular directory. What do you do?
    If you dont have a practice to use the keyboard we use mouse and we create file.I believe you are inside the qxf2-page-object model directory.If not please change the directory location. Now you have to create a new file called file1.py in the another reposiotory. Make sure you use the keyboard only.

3. copy files from one location to another
    Create new reposiotory called learn-keyboard-sequence. Clone the reposiotory into your local machine. Now copy all the files and directory from Qxf2 Page object model to the new reposiotory. Here the challenge is dont use the windows explorer ,cut and paste with. Use only keyboard to to the operation

4. move files from one location to another
    Create one new file(using keyboard) called test_keyboard.py inside pageobjects directory which is inside the new reposiotory you have created. Usually we keep all the test files inside test directory. So try to move the newly created file to the test directory.

5. create an alias with variable names to help me move faster
    Everytime you run the tests in Qxf2 Page Object model or other reposiotory you have to create the virtual environment and then you have to activate and deactivate when ever you work on the directory. So its very difficult to type the lenghty process and you have to remember the virtual environment name. Can you try to find a shortcut or an easy way to perform the operation. Can you try to create the 'alias' operation in your machine and try to use it every time.

6. write a simple bash script for performing repeated commands
    In our tests folder we have set of tests and all test should be run one by one. We can use pytest to run all the test in one command. But can you try to write the shell script to rull all our test in one command(without using pytest)?You have to run the test in the local machine and then the test should run in the Browserstack also

7. Pipe,append and redirect command
    Run test_example_form.py and redirect the output to the file called example_form.txt.Now using grep find the file and find how many failures and passed are there.
