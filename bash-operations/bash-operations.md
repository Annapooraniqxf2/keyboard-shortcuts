"""
Here we give a set of exercises to practice. All these exercises to be performed by using the keyboard. To perform all these exercises we are going to use our Qxf2 Page Object Model repository. So make sure you have already cloned the repository on your local machine.
"""

1. search through a directory for a file
    I hope you have already gone through our Page Object Model. So You have to find in which file we have kept all the common selenium methods. If you still didn't get it, I can say that it's Base_Page.py. Can you please search the file location without exploring into windows, without using the mouse?

2. create a new file without leaving the current directory
    If I ask you to create a file inside a particular directory. What do you do?
    If you don't have a practice to use the keyboard we use mouse and we create file.I believe you are inside the qxf2-page-object model directory.If not please change the directory location. Now you have to create a new file called file1.py in the other repository. Make sure you use the keyboard only.

3. copy files from one location to another
    Maybe you should know what command you have to use it for copying the files from one repository to another repository without using mouse. The reason here you will be going to use our framework and you have to copy some set of files from the qxf2-page-object-model to your own repository, for example files like Base_page.py, DriverFactory and some files inside the utils folder. So try copying all the files now.

4. move files from one location to another
    Create one new file(using keyboard) called test_keyboard.py inside page objects directory which is inside the new repository you have created. Usually, we keep all the test files inside the test directory. So try to move the newly created file to the test directory.

5. create an alias with variable names to help me move faster
    Every time you run the tests in Qxf2 Page Object model or other repository, you have to create the virtual environment and then you have to activate and deactivate whenever you work on the directory. So it's very difficult to type the lengthy process and you have to remember the virtual environment name. Can you try to find a shortcut or an easy way to perform the operation. Can you try to create the 'alias' operation in your machine and try to use it every time. And also try to create the 'alias' for your Git operations which you use frequently. Like git pull,push etc...

6. write a simple bash script for performing repeated commands
    In our tests folder we have set of tests and all test should be run one by one. We can use pytest to run all the test in one command. But can you try to write the shell script to rull all our test in one command(without using pytest)?You have to run the test in the local machine and then the test should run in the Browserstack also

7. Pipe, append, and redirect command
    Run test_example_form.py and redirect the output to the file called example_form.txt.Now using grep find the file and find how many failures and passed are there.

8. In the terminal, I no longer cd to the directory of a file that I want to operate upon
    Your task is to run the test test_example_form.py. Do you remember where is the file located? If not search it and now you will get the location. To run the test you may need to cd to the directory where it's listed. Try navigate it.Ok, what did you do?
    Have you done cd to the directory each time or the entire path
    If you have given the entire path and moved it then it's a good practice to do

9. Home directory, Current directory and Parrent Directory
    Your task is to move the file from Downloads to your current directory. But you just imagine that you know only the filename, but you don't know the location. Try to use the proper commands without using GUI and move it

10. Using vi editor
    ssh into your Ec2 instance. If you have cloned our Qxf2 Page object model repository,  you can skip this step or clone it. Open the file called Base_Page.py in the vi or vim editor.
    Now search the method called smart_wait and change the wait seconds to 10. Here you try to remember you are trying to do some insert operation in vi editor. Go to the start of the file and check do we have a docstring and you come to know the purpose of the page. Now go to the end of the file and check do we have any extra lines. We should not leave any new lines at the end of the file. Can you delete the docstring line of the wait method and add another docstring. Now without saving the file come out the editor.

11. Multiple Bash/command and switch between those windows
    Open the Bash and run our Qxf2 Page object model test. Open another Bash terminal and start working. Open the Python interpreter and check how the range function works. Now go to the bash which is running the test. But remember you have to use the keyboard to switch between these prompts
