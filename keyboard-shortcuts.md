---------------------
Here we do set of sequential operations with keyboard instead of mouse.
---------------------

1. Every time you create a repository or work on some other repository, you have to create the virtual environment and then you have to activate and deactivate whenever you work on the directory. So it's very difficult to type the lengthy process and you have to remember the virtual environment name. Can you try to find a shortcut or an easy way to perform the operation. Can you try to create the 'alias' operation in your machine and try to use it every time. And also try to create the 'alias' for your Git operations which you use frequently. Like git pull,push etc.... Create a 'alias' for this reposiotory. Clone it from [here](https://github.com/Annapooraniqxf2/keyboard-shortcuts/tree/rahul-keyboard-shortcuts).Use Git bash for cloning

2. Create a new branch because we are going to do the set of operations here.

3. Create new fille called 'fizzbuzz.py' inside the repository without using cd or mouse in the Git bash. Now can you open the same file without using the mouse in the Visual Studio Code and write the Python program (Fizz buzz) using methods. After completing the program, run it in the Visual Studio Code and Git bash. Now list the files in the bash and check the newly created files is displaying in the current location. Since you have added one file commit the changes and push it to your branch. I hope you have created some alias operations for Git bash so please do the git commit

4. Open a file 'fizzbuzz_gotoline.py' in Visual Studio Code, Goto the end of the file and check any extra space is there. If Yes delete the extra lines and save the program. Run the 'fizzbuzz_gotoline.py' program in the bash and see the error. Come to visual studio code and search the line number and fix the error. Go to git bash and run the program. To alternate between Visual Studio Code and Git bash use the keyboard. Do the commit.

5. Open the 'find_and_replace.py' file and search the word called 'app' and replace all with 'apps'. Do the commit.

6. Now, as part of the exercises you might have opened lots of tabs. Can you try to move between the tabs and check what are all the files opened and close the files if you are not going to work on it.

7.Create a new file called 'fizzbuzz_funtion.py' and open one more file which is already existing in the 'fizzbuzz_gotoline.py'. Copy the lines and paste it in the 'fizzbuzz_funtion.py'. Now modify the file by using only functions not with OOPS concepts. Now open one more bash don't close the already existing opened bash and run the program.Do the commit

8. Search the file name called autogenerate_xpath.py in the Git bash. If the file is in the directory run the file python autogenerate_xpath.py "please provide any url here". It will ask you to install set of libraries. Install it using pip. This program generates set of xpaths. Now try to append this xpath to any text file.The text file should be saved inside the downloads directory

9.Now move the text file inside the keyboard shortcut repository. Do the Git status now. Can you see the newly created text file in the status and it tells you to add it in to your repository. Maybe we dont need this text file to be pushed into Github repo. So add this file into the Git ignore.

10. Create one more file called perform_math.py. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).Now do you want to make sure how the for loop, range function and append list works in Python. Open your Python interpreter and try all the above keywords mentiond here. Now come back to your VS code and run the program both in Bash and VS code terminal. If you hit an error with any of these try to check in the interpreter one more time and run it. Do the commit

11. You have done so much commit now, do the Git squash and push it to the origin.

12. Now onwards we are going to use lot of vi editor. If you are having windows machine either you can create a virtual os and install ubuntu on it. If you have an aws account create an instance and ssh into it. WSL is a cool feature on Windows 10 that allows you to run most of the GNU/Linux commands and applications on Windows. If you want to do the setup you can simply follow this step [WSL](https://qxf2.com/blog/setup-linux-testing-environment-on-windows-using-wsl/)

13. Either do SSH or WSL or virtual os and now you have a ubuntu machine and clone this [repository] (https://github.com/Annapooraniqxf2/keyboard-shortcuts/tree/rahul-keyboard-shortcuts).Create a new file called 'fizzbuzz_fileread.py'. Now open the created file in the vi/vim editor. Now write a simple fizzbuzz program by reading the numbers from file. Make sure you have created the text file to read the input. Do the commit

14. Open a file called hangman.py and run the program. Check where are we giving the input words and change those words.As of now we are giving the hints for fruits. Change it to animals and run the program.Commit it

15. Go to the end of the program and delete the last commented statement. go to the starting of the program and include the docstrings.Commit it

16. The text file you have created as part of the fizzbuzz_fileread.py won't be there in your local windows machine. Find a way to copy from your ssh machine into your windows machine.

17. Push your changes to the Github from your ubuntu machine and pull these changes from the windows machine.
